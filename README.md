# Pluto 0.1.0
Work-in-progress C++ interpreter for the Pluto programming language.

Once completed, Pluto will be a lightweight, dynamic programming language with multithreading support.

Examples can be found in the `examples` folder.

# Status

Pluto is currently on release 0.1, an incomplete pre-release which lacks a large standard library and does not support features such as multithreading and inheritance. In the next release, Pluto's interpreter is planned to be reset and rebuilt from the ground-up and the aftermentioned features will be added.
